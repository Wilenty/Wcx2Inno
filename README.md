# Wcx2Inno use any WCX plug-in in your InnoSetup

I had prepared some examples to use with most popular InnoSetup versions of v5.x, v6.x and v6.2;  with: 7zip, CabWCX, iso, unrar, zip and zstd.

### Some of the Unicode WCX plug-ins may not work in the InnoSetup ANSI, but the WCX ANSI plug-ins should work in the InnoSetup Unicode.
